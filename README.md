# C--Attendance-System-Facial-Recog

This C++ program is an Attendance System that uses OpenCV for face detection to mark and display attendance for both students and teachers. It includes functionalities such as marking attendance by capturing face images through a webcam, saving the images, and logging attendance details in text files. Users can mark attendance for students and teachers, view attendance logs, and exit the program through a simple command-line menu. The program structure involves a main class (AttendanceSystem) with methods for marking and viewing attendance, and the main function implements a user interface to interact with the system. The code is organized, commented, and provides a basic console-based attendance management system.
